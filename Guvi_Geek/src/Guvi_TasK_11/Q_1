In Java, there are four access modifiers that control the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and variables. These modifiers determine whether a class, method, or variable can be accessed from other classes or packages. Here are the four access modifiers and their significance:

Public (public):

Classes: A public class can be accessed from any other class or package. For example, if a class is declared as public class MyClass, it can be accessed by any other class in any package.
Methods: A public method can be called from any other class. It is part of the class's public interface. Other classes can create objects of this class and call its public methods.
Variables: A public variable can be accessed and modified directly from any other class.
Protected (protected):

Classes: The protected access modifier is not applicable to classes directly.
Methods: A protected method can be accessed within the same package or subclass (in any package). This means that subclasses can access and override protected methods of their superclass.
Variables: A protected variable can be accessed within the same package or by subclasses.
Default (Package-private):

Classes: If no access modifier is specified (also known as "default" or "package-private"), it means the class is accessible only within its own package. Classes without an access specifier have default (package-private) access.
Methods: A method without any access modifier (default) is accessible within the same package but not from outside the package.
Variables: Variables without an access modifier (default) can be accessed within the same package but are not accessible from outside the package.
Private (private):

Classes: The private access modifier is not applicable to classes directly.
Methods: A private method can only be accessed within the same class. It is not visible or accessible to any other class, including subclasses.
Variables: A private variable can only be accessed within the same class. Other classes cannot directly access or modify private variables.

// Example of public access modifier
public class MyClass {
    public int publicVar;
    public void publicMethod() {
        // Code accessible from anywhere
    }
}

// Example of protected access modifier
class Parent {
    protected void display() {
        // Code accessible within the same package or by subclasses
    }
}

// Example of default (package-private) access modifier
class PackagePrivateClass {
    void defaultMethod() {
        // Code accessible within the same package
    }
}

// Example of private access modifier
class PrivateExample {
    private int privateVar;
    private void privateMethod() {
        // Code accessible only within this class
    }
}
